# Introducing Zngly

Zngly is a no-code media platform for the creation, management and measurement of content marketing and client engagement.

In a world swamped with information overload, Zngly helps firms cut through the noise and get noticed.

The platform is rich in functionality enabling marketing and sales teams to publish and share videos, documents, podcasts and more from across the web on their own website, and direct to their clients, without the need for designers and developers.

Say goodbye to file attachments! Everything is digital and fully secure with permissioned based sharing of content so you know who is sending, receiving and interacting with your material. With personalised video messaging for you to directly reach your target audience in the most engaging way.

Cloud delivered as a suite of CRM tools that integrate seamlessly with your existing web presence, supporting Salesforce and Hubspot, with comprehensive real-time analytics, Zngly brings content and client engagement to life.

The web is dead. Welcome to the future.
